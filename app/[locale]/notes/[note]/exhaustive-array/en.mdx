When I have a little time to spend in between some tasks, I usually wander on TS-related discord channels and lend a hand in helping channels. Here's a fun question I spent some time solving:

> Is it possible to create a type Exhaustive\<U, A\> that checks that every element of the array A is a constituent of the union U and each constituent of U appears exactly once in A?

Here is my stab at it:

```ts twoslash
type Exhaustive<U, A extends unknown[]> = [U] extends [never] 
  ? A extends []
    ? true
    : false
  : A extends [infer F, ...infer Rest]
  ? F extends U
    ? Exhaustive<Exclude<U, F>, Rest>
    : false
  : false;
```

As the name suggests, we have to exhaust all the possible pairs U-A, so we're going to recursively check them all by removing the pairs from subsequent checks, until the array is empty and the union is never.

```ts twoslash
type Exhaustive<U, A extends unknown[]> = [U] extends [never] 
  ? A extends []
    ? true
    : false
  : A extends [infer F, ...infer Rest]
  ? F extends U
    ? Exhaustive<Exclude<U, F>, Rest>
    : false
  : false;
// ---cut---
// Basic case
type T1 = Exhaustive<'a'|'b'|'c', ['a','b','c']>
//   ^?


// Union and tuple have different order
type T2 = Exhaustive<'a'|'b'|'c', ['b','c','a']>
//   ^?


// Duplicate element in array
type T3 = Exhaustive<'a'|'b'|'c', ['a','a','b','c']>
//   ^?


// Shorter array
type T4 = Exhaustive<'a'|'b'|'c', ['a','b']>
//   ^?


// Shorter tuple
type T5 = Exhaustive<'a'|'b', ['a','b','c']>
//   ^?
```

While I don't know what use case this might serve (the original poster didn't mention it), this was a fun challenge nonetheless.
